Tables from Lionel Hammerle
For accretion at various rates
Ignore time dependence, assume a 2D table in M, Mdot

Here are the tables for Mdot=1e-5, 1e-4 and 1e-3 Msun/yr.
The columns are:
- the age in years
- the current mass in Msun
- the photospheric radius in log(R/Rsun)
- the photospheric luminosity in log(L/Lsun)
- the effective temperature in log(T[K])
- the ionising flux in log(number of photons per second)
- the Lyman-Werner flux in log(number of photons per second)

Tables are popiii_grid_[T,radius].dat
Tables generated by readpopiii.py (reader.Make2DTables is the reader class function, see bottom of python module)

Function to read the table started in sx_popiiitables.c (untested), reads table into a struct
TODO:
- Figure out how 2D array is ordered in C, maybe make a get/set item function with index in (accretion rate, stellar mass)
- Write function to interpolate on the table and return a value (I should have this in Fortran already, but it needs to be in C ideally)
- Test module and values it outputs
